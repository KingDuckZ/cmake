CXX_STANDARD
------------

The C++ standard whose features are required to build this target.

This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are required
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.

Supported values are ``98`` and ``11``.

This property is initialized by the value of
the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` variable if it is set when a target
is created.
